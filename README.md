A multi page Power BI dashboard that analyzes demographic, lifestyle, clinical, and outcome variables from the Framingham Heart Study. Advanced DAX measures and calculated columns derive actionable KPIs. Pages are designed for Executive Overview, Clinical Insights, and Risk Outcomes with slicers and diverse visuals to highlight CHD drivers such as age, smoking, cholesterol, and hypertension.


## ✨ Features

Executive level KPIs including total patients, CHD incidence percent, diabetes percent, smokers percent, and hypertensive percent
Clinical KPIs such as average systolic blood pressure, average diastolic blood pressure, average total cholesterol, average heart rate, average cigarettes per day, and median systolic blood pressure
Interactive slicers for sex category, age bracket, BMI group, hypertension status, smoker status, and diabetes flag
Exploratory visuals including bar charts, line charts, donut charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and radar style charts
